<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
This report outlines key findings from the analysis of Walmart's sales data and presents actionable recommendations to boost sales.
The analysis identified the following critical factors influencing sales: fuel prices, temperature, holiday seasons, and unemployment rates.
Leveraging these insights, Walmart can adopt targeted strategies to enhance revenue and optimize customer engagement.

<h3>Key Findings</h3>
Fuel Prices: Higher fuel prices correlate with a decline in sales as customers reduce non-essential trips.
