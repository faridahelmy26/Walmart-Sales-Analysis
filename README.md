<h1>🔍 Project Details:</h1>
I analyzed a dataset containing weekly sales information from Walmart stores, along with factors such as temperature,
fuel prices, unemployment rates, and holiday flags. The goal of the project was to examine the relationship between these factors and their impact on sales.

<h1>💡 Steps I Followed:</h1>

Imported the data from a CSV file using pandas.
Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, including handling missing values.
Performed descriptive statistics to understand general trends in the data.
Created visualizations to understand the relationships between different factors like temperature, fuel prices, and their impact on sales.
<h1>📊 Key Findings:</h1>

Fuel Prices: Fuel prices had the most significant impact on sales, with increased prices leading to a decrease in sales.
Temperature: A clear relationship was found between temperature and sales, with higher sales in warmer summer months and lower sales in colder winter months.
Holidays: Sales were higher during holiday periods, indicating the effect of seasonal factors.
Unemployment Rates: Sales were negatively impacted by higher unemployment rates, with lower consumer spending during times of higher unemployment.
